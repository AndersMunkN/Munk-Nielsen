	abstract = { We introduce a computationally tractable dynamic equilibrium model of automobile markets with heterogeneous consumers, focused on stationary flow equilibria. We introduce a fast, robust algorithm for computing equilibria and use it to estimate a model using nearly 39 million observations on car ownership transitions from Denmark. The estimated model fits the data well, and counterfactual simulations show that Denmark could raise total tax revenue by reducing the new-car registration tax rate. We show that reducing this tax rate while raising the tax rate on fuel increases aggregate welfare, tax revenue, and car ownership, while reducing car ages, driving, and CO2 emissions. },

@article{lrt2020,
	abstract = {{We propose a novel method for modelling income processes using machine learning. Our method links age-specific regression trees, and returns a discrete state process, which can easily be included in consumption-saving models without further discretizations. A central advantage of our approach is that it does not rely on any parametric assumptions, and because we build on existing machine learning tools it is furthermore easy to apply in practice. Using a 30-year panel of Danish males, we document rich higher-order income dynamics, including substantial skewness and high kurtosis of income levels and growth rates. We also find important changes in income risk over the life-cycle and the income distribution. Our estimated process matches these dynamics closely. Using a consumption-saving model, the implied welfare cost of income risk is more than 10\\% of income.}},

@article{tails2019,
	abstract = {Pricing greenhouse gases is widely understood as the most efficient approach for mitigating climate change, yet distributional effects hamper political acceptance. These distributional effects are especially important in transport, the fastest growing sector for greenhouse gas emissions. Using rich data covering the entire population of vehicles and households in Denmark, this study uncovers an important feature of driving demand: two groups of much more responsive households in the lower and upper tails of the work distance distribution. We further estimate the causal effect of public transport--a critical determinant of the upper tail--and show how public transport access can both reconcile differences in fuel price elasticities between the United States and Europe, and considerably influence the distributional effects of fuel pricing.},

@article{hip2018,
	abstract = {This paper shows that a central implication of heterogeneous income profiles (HIP) is that the covariance between the level of income and future income growth rates must become strongly positive from about age 40. Covariances of income levels and future growth rates therefore have strong identifying power for HIP. We show that adding such moments to an estimation can reverse seemingly strong evidence of HIP. We show this both in a small sample Monte Carlo study and using PSID data. Our results are robust to including a fixed effect correlated with the HIP component.},

@article{taxincentives2016,
	abstract = {We estimate the effect of the Danish 1987 tax reform, which reduced the tax rate applied to interest deductions from 73% to 50% for households with high incomes, but less for households with middle or low incomes. Using high quality panel data we find that households responded to the reduced tax subsidy by lowering interest payments and we find that the responsiveness to the tax subsidy varies by the initial level of interest payments.},
