# Using an AI 

Times are changing as AI tools (chatGPT, copilot, etc.) are becoming better. By now, you should definitely be using these tools as much as possible, and for almost all stages. 

* **The role of AI:** The AI is a *new tool*. It is a **complement** to the supervisor, not a replacement. But it can seriously boost what you can get out of supervision. It is also a tool for writing and thinking that can boost your potential; but *avoid* becoming a blind passenger. You need to be in charge. 
* **Bonus co-supervisor:** Prompt your AI with e.g. *"You are a professor in economics and my supervisor in writing my bachelor's/master's thesis. (...)"* and then ask it whatever questions you have for me, your actual supervisor. Some questions actually have obvious answers, and frequently, this will help you refine and narrow down your questions to me. 
* **Writing:** Use it as much as possible. Your focus should be on a brief list of the arguments you want to make in each paragraph, and then the AI could help you flesh out the actual writing. 
* **Coding:** Obviously use it here. 
* **Brainstorming:** Use it to think through the steps of your analysis. Use prompts like: *I am writing a master's thesis in economics where I am estimating the fuel price elasticity of driving demand. Help me come up with good research questions for my thesis. Depending on what data I have, what could be the most interesting academic avenues to pursue?"* The AI will make suggestions for different types of datasets. Then explain to it what specific data you have, and have a conversation about what each direction would entail and what the pros and cons are.
* **Getting stuck:** If you are stuck, use the AI as sparring partner. Sometimes, the act of writing down and describing in detail what you are struggling with can; help you get unstuck. The AI can help you structure your thoughts and give you suggestions for how to proceed. Tell it to interview you about the problem and ask questions to help diagnose what is going on. For example, *"I am stuck with my thesis because I keep getting an unexpected sign on the price variable. I don't know if I have coded it up incorrecetly or if there is a problem in my data. Surely, the price variable must have a negative sign when estimating demand? Interview me about this issue and help me find out how to move forward, or to figure out which questions I should ask my supervisor at my next meeting."*
* **Pitfalls:** ***Never*** write ***anything*** in your thesis you don't understand. The AI tool may write a sentence that sounds great, but if you don't understand it, then it is ***plagiarism*** to writ it down. You must understand every single sentence in your thesis, and you must be able to explain it at the defense. You must expect that the external examiner and I will ask you about the sharpest points in your thesis -- so they must be fully your own. 
	* **Instead:** If an AI makes an excellent point, have a discussion with it. Ask it to explain and flesh out the argument. If you understand it and like the argument, then make it your own. If you are in doubt, take it up in supervision. Ultimately, you must be in control of your thesis.
