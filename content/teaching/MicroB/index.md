This is a second-year course at the bachelor in Computer Science & Economics. 

The course website is here: [GamEconCph](https://github.com/GamEconCph). Note the [tournament environment](https://github.com/GamEconCph/game-tournament) that I use to run algorithmic game competitions for students. 

*Note: The course is in Danish.*
